# Lightweight CI bench for the moving-average crossover harness.
# 512 bars keeps the 200-bar baseline indicator warm while still finishing
# in milliseconds, so the PERF_CHECK gate stays fast but stable.

  Runs a deterministic 32 vs 200 moving-average crossover. We keep the
  horizon pinned at 512 bars so both windows fully warm up; shorter lookbacks
  starve the long average and produce zero signals, which previously caused
  drift between the scenario and perf test expectations.
